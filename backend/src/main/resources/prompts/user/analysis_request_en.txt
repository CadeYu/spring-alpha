IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **DuPont Analysis**: Calculate ROE and break it down into Net Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Equity Multiplier.
2. **Insight Engine**:
   - identify any *changes in accounting policies* (e.g., revenue recognition, inventory valuation).
   - Provide *Root Cause Analysis* for major metric changes (e.g., if Gross Margin dropped, was it due to raw material costs or pricing pressure?).
3. **Factor Analysis**:
   - Create a *Revenue Bridge* (Volume vs Price vs FX).
   - Create a *Margin Bridge* (Cost vs Mix vs Operating Leverage).
   - *CRITICAL*: If exact numbers are not available for a factor, use "+" (positive impact), "-" (negative impact), or "flat". Do NOT return "Not available". Estimate direction based on text.
